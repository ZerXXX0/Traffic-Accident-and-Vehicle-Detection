# Traffic Accident and Vehicle Detection - Multimodal

Our web-based app, System of a Road AI, is a comprehensive multimodal system for detecting traffic accidents and vehicles using computer vision and machine learning techniques. This project combines multiple data sources and detection methods to provide accurate real-time traffic monitoring and accident detection capabilities.

## üöó Features

- **Real-time Vehicle Detection**: Detect and classify various types of vehicles (cars, trucks, motorcycles, buses)
- **Accident Detection**: Identify traffic accidents using multimodal analysis
- **Multi-camera Support**: Process feeds from multiple traffic cameras simultaneously
- **Alert System**: Automated notifications for detected incidents
- **Dashboard Interface**: Web-based monitoring dashboard for traffic management
- **Data Analytics**: Historical analysis and reporting of traffic patterns
- **API Integration**: RESTful API for third-party integrations

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, YOLO, TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **Machine Learning**: YOLOv12 and CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network)
- **Backend**: Streamlit
- **Frontend**: Streamlit, CSS
- **Real-time Processing**: Streamlit Cloud
- **Deployment**: Streamlit
